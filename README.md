# NUS Cheatsheets
This is a collection of cheatsheets I used for my study in NUS.

The distribution I used is [MiKTex](https://miktex.org/). PDFs are compiled on Windows 10.

Some notes, for the sake of convenience, are recorded in formats other than **.tex**
(e.g.: Microsoft Excel Document). I will try my best to put them in LaTeX format when I have time.

**Feel free to use them if they help and good luck to you.**

P.S. If there are any bugs prevent you from compiling the source files,
let me know by raising an issue or submit a pull request.

## Directory
Links are linked to the LaTeX source files. If you want an compiled PDF, please navigate youtself
