# NUS Cheatsheets
-----------------

This is a collection of cheatsheets I used for my study in NUS.
Part of them are inherited from some past works found on github.com done by my other students.
Credits are recorded in the source files as comments.

I am still new to LaTeX so if there are any bugs prevent you from compiling the source files,
let me know by raising an issue or submit a pull request.

The distribution I used is [MiKTex](https://miktex.org/). PDFs are compiled on Windows 10.
